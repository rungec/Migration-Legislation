Analysis relating to manuscript on Australian legislation for migratory birds

Summarises and tabulates the number of Australian bird species covered by the EPBC as threatened or migratory, and tabulates the region between which each species migrates (PNG, Indonesia, New Zealand, Palearctic, Oceanic, within-country).

###Data source
Species listings are drawn from *Garnett ST et al. 2015. Biological, ecological, conservation and legal information for all species and subspecies of Australian bird. Scientific Data 2. Available from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640137/ (accessed May 10, 2016)* and updated with EPBC status as of 30 Aug 2016. I updated the movement categories in the 2015 release, these will be reflected in the 2016 release.
